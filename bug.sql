The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause to select data from a table, but it includes an aggregate function (COUNT(*)) without a GROUP BY clause. This results in an error because the database system doesn't know how to handle the aggregate function without grouping the results. 
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_products,
    categories.category_name
FROM
    (SELECT product_id, category_id FROM products) AS product_data,
    categories
WHERE
    product_data.category_id = categories.category_id
GROUP BY
    categories.category_name; 
```
